# Monty Interpreter Project
### Description
This is an Interpreter to read .m files and take action on the code by parsing lines in the file before applying the required action.</br>
This requires knowledge about the LIFO and FIFO methods from stacks and queues, working together like a scheduler to make the code run as required.</br>
### Language
- C
### Contributors
- Elisha Ajayi (self)
### Note
After completing two ALX team projects so far, I decided to take this project alone to dig out my faults that caused hindrances in previous projects. Only by knowing myself well enough will I be able to cooperate with others and work effectively.</br>
